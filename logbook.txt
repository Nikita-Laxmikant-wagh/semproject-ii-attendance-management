1. Introduction
Problem Statement
Manual attendance systems are widely used in educational institutions and workplaces. These systems require either calling out names or using a register, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and susceptible to proxy attendance. Even biometric systems like fingerprint scanners are not immune to misuse and often fail under conditions like dirt, moisture, or injury on fingers. In the post-pandemic world, touchless systems are more desirable due to hygiene concerns. Therefore, there is a significant need for a contactless, automated, and reliable attendance system. The proposed system, based on facial recognition, offers a promising solution to these issues. It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and recognize faces, and automatically mark attendance, thereby saving time, increasing accuracy, and eliminating proxy attendance.
Objectives
•	Develop a contactless, automated attendance system using facial recognition.
•	Detect and recognize student faces using webcam input.
•	Store and manage attendance data efficiently.
•	Ensure high accuracy in real-time scenarios with varying lighting and facial expressions.
•	Provide a user-friendly interface for both administrators and users.
•	Enable data visualization of attendance reports.

2. Literature Survey
Background
Facial recognition technology has been widely used in security, authentication, and monitoring applications. It uses biometric software to identify or verify a person from a digital image or video source. This is achieved by analyzing the patterns of facial features.
Recent advancements in computer vision, especially through deep learning, have significantly improved the performance of face detection and recognition systems. Technologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH), and deep metric learning (FaceNet) have enabled highly accurate facial recognition under various conditions.
Existing Systems
1.	Face Recognition using LBPH – A traditional machine learning-based approach where features are extracted using local binary patterns.
2.	FaceNet and Dlib-based recognition – Advanced deep learning methods that map facial features to a high-dimensional embedding space.
3.	Smart Attendance Systems – Some educational institutions and companies use RFID or QR code systems, but these still require physical interaction.

Limitations of Existing Systems
•	Poor performance in low-light conditions.
•	High hardware requirements for real-time processing.
•	Challenges with occlusion, varying facial expressions, and aging.
•	Insecure data handling in some open-source systems.
